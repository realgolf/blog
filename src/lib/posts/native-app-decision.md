At RealGolf.Games, we're dedicated to providing a comprehensive platform for golf training and skill improvement. However, you might have noticed that we haven't ventured into the realm of native app development, and we wanted to take a moment to explain why.

## Resource Constraints and Academic Commitments

One of the primary reasons behind our decision is our current resource constraints. RealGolf.Games is completely developed and maintained by just one individual ‚Äì a developer who is still studying for his GCSE. Balancing the demands of academic studies with the responsibilities of managing and enhancing RealGolf.Games presents its own set of challenges.

## Longer Development Cycles

In addition to resource constraints, the decision not to pursue native app development is also influenced by the longer development cycles associated with maintaining both a web platform and a native app. With limited resources, it becomes increasingly difficult to dedicate time and effort to ensuring timely updates, feature enhancements, and bug fixes across multiple platforms.

Moreover, the process of updating native apps can be cumbersome. App stores typically take up to 24 hours to review changes, and it may take users up to a week to download these updates. We do not want to force any users to download updates.

## Focus on Web Platform

By prioritizing our web platform, we can streamline our development efforts and focus on delivering the best possible experience for our users. The web platform offers several advantages, including quicker iteration, easier updates, and a more seamless user experience across different devices.

## Conclusion
